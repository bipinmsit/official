                                Drones, or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), are an incredible piece of technology providing a vantage platform from which to observe things. Sensors on the other hand are the equivalent of the human senses. Together, sensors mounted on drones, can collect all kinds of data. <br />
                                However data is only meaningful if converted into information. Thatâ€™s the mission of Aspec Scire, Latin for elevated viewing.
